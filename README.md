# Auto-retinoscopy

This repo contains the code for the video analysis pipeline for the paper *Towards Automating Retinoscopy for Refractive Error Diagnosis* accepted at the IMWUT 2022. The input to the system is a *retinoscopic video*, with the patient wearing a custom pair of paper frames, and the output is the net refractive power of the eye along the scoped meridian.

The aim of this README is to describe in detail the video analysis pipeline for ease of understanding and usage by a beginner user. The readme describes in detail the different functions and parameters of the pipeline along with the code snippets.

The figure below illustrates the (a) Proposed setup consisting of a retinoscope attached to a smartphone, (b) the setup from the patientâ€™s viewpoint facing the logMAR chart, (c) retinoscope and its vergence sleeve, and (d) a single frame of the digital retinoscopy video with automatic detection of fiducials, pupil, reflex edges, and beam edges, using our video processing pipeline.

## Image Processing Pipeline Overview

</p>


The video analysis pipeline takes as input the video collected via a smartphone attached to the retinoscope, and outputs the net refractive power of the eye along the scoped horizontal meridian. The analysis pipeline first performs **pre-processing** (*image cropping, and tracking*) on the input image. The next step is to detect the **fiducial markers**, and correct for the perspective distortions. This is followed by **beam and pupil detection and reflex edge localization** in the respective search spaces. Finally the refractive power is estimated based on the mathematical model explained in the paper.

## Running Script

`python annotate_init_bbox.py --input_dir <input_dir> --video <video_name.mp4> --frame_size 2`

This command will prompt the user to draw a rough bounding box across the paper frame. The frame size and input bounding box will be saved in the *init_bbox.csv* file.

`python velocity_pipeline.py --video <video_name.mp4>`

This command will load the default parameters from the *input_params.yaml* and save the intermediate frames with detected fiducials, beam, pupil and reflex in the output directory. The final predicted power will be stored in the output csv file in the same directory.

## About the code:

* `velocity_pipeline.py` : This is the main file which processes the video based upon input parameters.
* `annotate_init_bbox.py` : Prompts the user to draw initial rough bounding box across the paper frame.
* `beam.py` : Detects the pixel locations of the retinoscopic beam given the location of the fiducial markers.
* `eyes.py`: Detects the pupil and pixel locations for the left and right reflex edge given the cropped region of interest.
* `fiducials.py`: Detects the square fiducials in the input video.

**Note** : The video processing pipeline for now only supports retinoscopic beam scoped along horizontal meridian at 0 degree, with video resolution at `4096 x 2160` pixels. Although, the working distance is calculated automatically using size of detected fiducials, capture videos from 30-40 cm from the eyes to maintain the trade-off between resolution and decreasing pupil size due to accommodation.
